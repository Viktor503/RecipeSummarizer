{"messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "<website>\t \tRecipes\tEveryday Cooking \tBaked Chicken Thighs Coated With Corn Flake Crumbs\t4.0\t(1)\t1 Review\t2 Photos\tI like these cornflake chicken thighs so much that I make them often. The Sriracha scarcely adds any heat at all (mainly flavor), so don't worry about spiciness. For overall crispiness, I usually bake the thighs on a baking rack that's been placed over a foil-lined half-sheet pan. Don't omit the sugar, as it helps the coating adhere to the chicken. By the way, cornflake crumbs are usually sold in supermarkets near the bread crumbs and coating mixes, not in the cereal aisle.\tSubmitted by\tDoug in Manhattan\tPublished on June 19, 2020\t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tPrep Time:\t30 mins\tCook Time:\t 1 hr\tAdditional Time:\t15 mins\tTotal Time:\t 1 hr 45 mins\tServings:\t8 \tJump to Nutrition Facts\tIngredients\t \t8  chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and skin\t1 \u00bd cups corn flake crumbs\t1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce\t1 tablespoon sriracha sauce\t1 tablespoon sweet paprika\t2 teaspoons rice vinegar\t2 teaspoons white sugar\tDirections\t Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a half-sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place a baking rack on top.\t Place corn flake crumbs in a bowl.\t Mix teriyaki sauce, Sriracha sauce, paprika, rice vinegar, and sugar together in a large bowl until sauce has a thick consistency.\t Place chicken thighs in the bowl with sauce. Tumble thighs together until completely coated. Smear sauce onto any bare spots and under any loose flaps of skin.\t Place 1 thigh into the bowl with corn flakes. Spoon crumbs on top using a tablespoon. Press crumbs onto thigh using the back of the spoon, pressing thigh down into crumbs to coat underside. Turn over and repeat pressing. Place onto the baking rack, skin-side up. Repeat with remaining thighs and crumbs, placing largest thighs in the corners of the rack to receive the most heat.\t Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes depending on the size of thighs. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn thighs over to help undersides crisp up. Bake until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\t Let thighs rest on the baking rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.\t  Tips  \t The sauce is not a marinade, so don't let the thighs sit in it for very long, or else its salty ingredients will extract moisture that you want to remain in the thighs. Also, watery sauce won't hold the corn flake crumbs onto the thighs.\t Small thighs may take only 55 minutes, but very large thighs may take an hour and a quarter.\t Refrigerate any leftovers only after they've cooled significantly (to minimize condensation of steam). Place a double layer of paper towels under them.\t Simpler method: Line your pan with aluminum foil. Don't use a baking rack. Coat only the skin side of the thighs with corn flake crumbs. Bake them skin side up, without turning them over.\t Chicken finger variation: Use chicken breast cutlets sliced into 1-inch-wide fingers.

It\u2019s an easy, gooey meal that can be topped with whatever you like. When served warm, the chocolate chips melt in your mouth.\u00a0\t This recipe for chocolate chip pancakes is pretty straight-forward. The recipe includes milk and white vinegar, which you combine at the beginning to sour the milk, creating something similar to buttermilk.\u00a0\t Along with the milk mixture, the batter is also made from all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda, eggs, salt, butter, vanilla, and mini chocolate chips. Depending on the sugar content of the chocolate you buy, chocolate will generally be a little bittersweet.\t You should definitely top the pancake with a generous slice of butter, as you would any pancake. Maple syrup pairs well with chocolate, but if you are looking to add other topping or ingredients, a little whipped cream works well, as do bananas, fresh berries in the spring, or a cinnamon in the fall.\u00a0\t \u201cThe carbohydrates in pancakes make them a reliable freeze-and-store food item,\u201d writes Alice Knisley Matthias. \u201cTry freezing plain buttermilk pancakes, whole wheat, cornmeal, buckwheat, and beyond.

The recipe includes plain yogurt and bananas, so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture. Banana muffins taste similar to banana bread\u2014and very ripe bananas, like banana bread, will work best for this recipe.\t Not to fear though, this recipe is very easy to make: Just combine your dry ingredients and your wet ingredients separately, then stir together until combined. Then, you\u2019ll fold in the bananas and chocolate chips, portion into muffin tins, and let your oven do the rest of the work.\t Banana Chocolate chip muffins are a nice, warm treat almost anytime. If you like to change up your morning meal now and then or take a snack with you for the day, this is a great way to do that. Store these muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to five days or in the freezer for up to three months.

This recipe combines spicy chorizo, sour cream, cheddar cheese, eggs, and frozen hash browns for a creamy, decadent dish that\u2019s sure to please adults and kids alike.

And yet, the taste is virtually identical to classic eggs Benedict.\tBy\t John Mitzewich\t \t \tJohn Mitzewich\t \t \t \tJohn Mitzewich \u2014 aka Chef John \u2014 has produced more than 1,500 cooking videos for Allrecipes.\u00a0He's the actor, director, and screenwriter whose hands and voice confidently walk you through techniques.\tAllrecipes' editorial guidelines\tUpdated on April 30, 2024\t \t \t \t \t \t \t2\t2\t \tPrep Time:\t10 mins\tCook Time:\t25 mins\tTotal Time:\t35 mins\tServings:\t2 \tJump to Nutrition Facts\t This easy, stripped-down version of eggs benedict involves no poaching, or hollandaise sauce making, which are the top two reasons people don\u2019t make eggs benedict. Even if you master both those elements, and if you\u2019ve seen our videos on them there\u2019s a good chance you have, classic eggs benedict is still not something you make for one, which is why this method is such an exciting breakthrough. Thanks to some baked-in-a-ham-cup eggs, and a simple-to-make lemon butter sauce, the taste is virtually identical to classic eggs Benedict.\t One could argue baked eggs can\u2019t compare to perfectly poached ones, so if you want to poach instead, feel free, but the lemon butter sauce here is no compromise. All we\u2019ve done is remove the yolk from a hollandaise, and since we\u2019re serving this over eggs, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be missed. In fact, I believe some, if not most, will find this version preferable, which is why I really do hope you give it a try soon.

Dipping bread or toast into a runny egg is never not a wonderful breakfast experience, but when that egg is swimming in a spicy, aromatic tomato-pepper sauce, things get elevated to a whole new level.\t I'm not sure if you garden, but if you don\u2019t, shakshuka is a wonderful reason to start.

Tomatoes, peppers, and herbs are some of the easiest things to grow, even for beginners, and I can\u2019t think of a better place for them to end up than this. And when you take a break from shakshuka, you can use those things in a frittata, which we also have many videos for.
